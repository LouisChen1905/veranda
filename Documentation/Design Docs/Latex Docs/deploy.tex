\chapter{Release -- Setup -- Deployment}
\section{Deployment Information and Dependencies}
At the time of this writing, there is no deployment available other than installing the full development environment. Following the steps defined in section \ref{sec:devenv} to get the development environment set up for your system.

In the future, we hope to have pre-made VM's, Docker Containers, and/or Binary packages available for easy installation.

\section{Setup Information}
Once the development environment is set up, create a folder to be your ROS workspace. Within the workspace, create a \lstinline|src| folder. Within \lstinline|src|, clone the project repository.

\subsection*{Building}
In a terminal with a build environment (Any linux terminal, a VS2015 Tools terminal on Windows) \lstinline|source| (\lstinline|call| on Windows) the \lstinline|setup.bash/.bat| file appropriate for you system in your ROS installation folder. Now, from the workspace root, run the command \lstinline|ament build|. This will build the project.

\subsection*{Running}
To run the project, \lstinline|source|/\lstinline|call| the \lstinline|setup.bash/.bat| file in the \lstinline|install| subfolder of the workspace. Then, run \lstinline|ros2 run sdsmt_simulator sdsmt_simulator|
